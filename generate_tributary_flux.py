#NEED TO FIND TO CALCULATE THIS

# - GPS coordinates of canonical flowline - ask Kiya about
# - GPS coordinates of where tributaries flow into flowline
# - velocities at where tributaries flow into flowline
# - some estimate of glacier depth where tributaries flow in (from Nolan et al?)
# - 

#1. Create flowline, or have Kiya create it. Ideally, will be series of points every 100m along center of glacier, with UTM coordinates of each point.

#2. Then, can also find surface elevations at each of those UTM coordinates to get the true surface elevation.

#3. Same thing with velocity along the flowline.

#4. Find (approximate?) points where tributaries flow into the Taku, find UTM coordinates of entire length of tributary cross-sections.

#5. Calculate flux in at each point with some guess as to the depth of the glacier at those points.

#6. Then, (perhaps visually is the best way to do this), assign the flux values to certain nodes' mbal values.

#7. Profit???
